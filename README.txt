#Front End Nanodegree Project 4 Feed Reader Testing

#Author: Shavaun Brandy

#Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in. 


#Instructions 

The project can be viewed by clicking the green button above labeled "Clone or Download". You must then extract the zip file that was downloaded. The project can be opened by navigating to the index.html document and opening this document in your browser of choice.


##Dependencies
